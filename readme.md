### Backups
*	At minimum, use an external hard drive/ flash drive

	*	Windows Backup
*	Consider using a "Sync" Service
	*	OIT's license for your Google Account includes 'UNLIMITED' storage space
	*	Google "CU Boulder Cloud Storage" for [info](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/it-security/guidelines-storing-documents-cloud "OIT CLoud Storage Guidelines") on Cloud Storage
	* 	[Google Sync Client](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987 "Backup and Sync files with Google Drive")
* Git? Do you need version control?
	*	What version of code produced this model?
	* 	"Rats! why did I delete that line in my R code, now I don't remember what it was"

*	FERPA/ HIPPA/ Other very informative acronyms?
	* 	The EBIO department has access to a NFS fileshare with limited space. If you need access to this space, ask your advisor to send me a request via email.

### Security and Passwords
While still prevalent, viruses that simply infect your computer are much less of a concern than they were years ago. The most vulnerable data is information about you, your credit cards, SSN, passwords, etc.

Can you encrypt your computer?
* 	Mac: [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)
*	Windows: [BitLocker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028713/windows-10-turn-on-device-encryption)

The most important thing we can do to protect ourselves is practice diligent browsing and use extra awesome passwords. Password managers are an inexpensive way of managing your digital life. Many can automatically change your passwords on a regular basis. The *best* passwords are unrelated phrases with special characters.

Run security updates. Seriously, run them once a month at least. Update your software.

#### Password Managers
* [1Password](https://1password.com/) "1Password Home Page"
* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) "Last Pass Home Page"

### Manage your Data
How long is this grad school thing going to take? Realistically, can you remember where that *one* file from your college stats course is located on your computer? There is no right or wrong solution, make an effort to manage your projects and data. 

Save sources and track your citations using a citation manager.

* [EndNote](http://endnote.com/)

Backup your data, have a plan to keep working on another computer if your current device fails.

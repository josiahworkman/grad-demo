# Tips for Grad Students at CU Boulder

This is an outline for students working at CU Boulder to succeed in all the things!

## Top Three Things
* Backup Everything and have a Backup Backup Plan
* Security updates and Passwords
* Manage your data 	

### Backups
* At minimum, use an external hard drive/ flash drive
	* Time Machine Backups
	* Windows Backup
* Consider using a "Sync" Service
	* OIT's license for your Google Account includes 'UNLIMITED' storage space
	* Google "CU Boulder Cloud Storage" for [info](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/it-security/guidelines-storing-documents-cloud "OIT Cloud Storage Guidelines") on Cloud Storage
	* [Google Sync Client](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987 "Backup and Sync files with Google Drive")
* Git? Do you need version control?
	* What version of code produced this model?
	* "Rats! why did I delete that line in my R code, now I don't remember what it was"
	* "Things were working yesterday, what changed???"
	* Learn [Git](https://try.github.io "15min Git Tutorial") in 15 minutes!
		* While you are at it, learn how to use a text editor
			* [sublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
			* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
* FERPA/ HIPPA/ Other very informative acronyms?
	*  The EBIO department has access to a NFS fileshare with limited space. If you need access to this space, ask your advisor to send me a request via email.

### Security and Passwords
While still prevalent, viruses that simply infect your computer are much less of a concern than they were years ago. The most vulnerable data is information about you, your credit cards, SSN, passwords, etc.

#### Can you encrypt your computer?
* Mac: [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)
* Windows: [BitLocker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028713/windows-10-turn-on-device-encryption)

The most important thing we can do to protect ourselves is practice diligent browsing and use extra awesome passwords. Password managers are an inexpensive way of managing your digital life. Many can automatically change your passwords on a regular basis. The *best* passwords are unrelated phrases with special characters.

Run security updates. Seriously, run them once a month at least. Update your software.

#### Password Managers
* [1Password](https://1password.com/) "1Password Home Page"
* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) "Last Pass Home Page"

### Manage your Data
How long is this grad school thing going to take? Realistically, can you remember where that *one* file from your college stats course is located on your computer? There is no right or wrong solution, make an effort to manage your projects and data. 

Save sources and track your citations using a citation manager.

* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)
* [EndNote](http://endnote.com/)

Backup your data, have a plan to keep working on another computer if your current device fails. 

## Google is your friend
Things at CU are, despite the popular belief, rather well documented on-line.
Need software? Google "CU Boulder Software"
Need to learn about compute clusters available to students? Google "CU Boulder Clusters"
Purchasing? rules about leaving the country? Grants? Most policies and procedures are documented somewhere across the CU websites.

To that point, everything on [OIT's website](https://oit.colorado.edu) is going to be very helpful as you navigate your way through grad school. OIT's website is the go-to location for software, it's updated regularly and all info on purchasing can be found on the site as well. 

Furthermore, anything to do with research computing can be found on [Research Computing website](https://rc.colorado.edu). They have a very helpful support staff and are willing to help you get started with using the compute clusters. You have to teach yourself some basic skills with the command line to work with Research Computing hardware, but it's well worth your time. Last but not least, Research Computing holds demo courses every month or so - check their website for more.

## We are also your friend
For any department specific questions, the office staff should be a good point of contact. 
[Here is what we do](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/people/staff)

The [EBIO website](https://colorado.edu/ebio) is a great location for public facing data

The [EBIO SharePoint](https://https://o365coloradoedu.sharepoint.com/sites/ebio/) site is the go-to location for anything that wouldn't be public facing data. This includes procedures and documentation specific to our department.

## Best tools for the job. Software and Hardware recommendations

### Writing
For simple projects Microsoft Word is great. For anything with complex graphics or code students might consider using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

### Designing
Hey, PowerPoint is already on my computer and I can use it to make posters right? Yes and no. PowerPoint is abysmally suited for typesetting or layers. OpenSource design software exists to compete with Adobe and PowerPoint as design solutions. Both GIMP And InkScape would compete with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator respectively.

* [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/en/)

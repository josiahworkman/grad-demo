### Security and Passwords

While still prevalent, viruses that simply infect your computer are much less of a concern than they were years ago. The most vulnerable data is information about you, your credit cards, SSN, passwords, etc.

The most important thing we can do to protect ourselves is practice diligent browsing and use extra awesome passwords. Password managers are an inexpensive way of managing your digital life. Many can automatically change your passwords on a regular basis. The *best* passwords are unrelated phrases with special characters.

#### Password Managers

# Tips for Grad Students at CU Boulder

This is an outline for students working at CU Boulder to succeed in all the things!

## Top Three Things
* Backup Everything and have a Backup Plan
* Security updates and Passwords
* Manage your data 	

### Backups
* At minimum, use an external hard drive/ flash drive
	* [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) Backups
	* [Windows Backup](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore)
* Consider using a "Sync" Service
	* OIT's license for your Google Account includes 'UNLIMITED' storage space
	* Google "CU Boulder Cloud Storage" for [info](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/it-security/guidelines-storing-documents-cloud "OIT Cloud Storage Guidelines") on Cloud Storage
	* [Google Sync Client](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987 "Backup and Sync files with Google Drive")
* Git? Do you need version control?
	* What version of code produced this model?
	* "Rats! why did I delete that line in my R code, now I don't remember what it was"
	* "Things were working yesterday, what changed???"
	* Learn [Git](https://try.github.io "15min Git Tutorial") in 15 minutes!
		* While you are at it, learn how to use a text editor
			* [sublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
			* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
*  The EBIO department has access to a fileshare with limited space. If you need access to this space, ask your advisor to send me a request via email.

### Security and Passwords
While still prevalent, viruses that simply infect your computer are much less of a concern than they were years ago. The most vulnerable data is information about you, your credit cards, SSN, passwords, etc.

#### Can you encrypt your computer?
* Mac: [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)
* Windows: [BitLocker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028713/windows-10-turn-on-device-encryption)

The most important thing we can do to protect ourselves is practice diligent browsing and use extra awesome passwords. Password managers are an inexpensive way of managing your digital life. Many can automatically change your passwords on a regular basis. The *best* passwords are unrelated phrases with special characters.

Run security updates. Seriously, run them once a month at least. Update your software.

#### Password Managers
* [1Password](https://1password.com/) "1Password Home Page"
* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) "Last Pass Home Page"

### Manage your Data
How long is grad school going to take? Realistically, can you remember where that *one* file from your college stats course is located on your computer? There is no right or wrong solution, make an effort to manage your projects and data. 

Save sources and track your citations using a citation manager.
* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)
* [EndNote](http://endnote.com/) Discount at the CU Book Store

Backup your data, have a plan to keep working on another computer if your current device fails. 

What happens if you or someone in your lab leaves CU?
Currently CU isn't removing data associated with account but that policy is subject to change and we can expect it to change shortly. If you graduate will your collaborators have access to your data?

[Email for life](https://oit.colorado.edu/efl) Through the Email for Life program, CU Boulder graduates will automatically keep registered colorado.edu email addresses accessible through Google. Graduates should also retain access to any of the files stored in their Google Drives and the storage capacity should remain 'unlimited' post-graduation. 

## Collaboration Software
New as of 2018, the University of Colorado Boulder has invested in two collaboration products that labs should consider using, [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Google Team Drives](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/drive/get-started-team-drive/#!/). 

For slack-like communication Microsoft Teams offers a full suite of collaboration and file storage software. 

Google Team Drives will be available soon.

## Navigating the resources at CU
Things at CU are, despite the popular belief, rather well documented on-line.
Need software? Google "CU Boulder Software"
Need to learn about compute clusters available to students? Google "CU Boulder Clusters"
Purchasing? rules about leaving the country? Grants? Most policies and procedures are documented somewhere across the CU websites.

To that point, everything on [OIT's website](https://oit.colorado.edu) is going to be very helpful as you navigate your way through grad school. OIT's website is the go-to location for software, it's updated regularly and all info on purchasing can be found on the site as well. 

Furthermore, anything to do with scale computing can be found on the [Research Computing website](https://rc.colorado.edu). They have a very helpful support staff and are willing to help you get started with using the compute clusters. You have to teach yourself some basic skills with the command line to work with Research Computing hardware, but it's well worth your time. Last but not least, Research Computing holds demo courses every month or so - check their website for more.

## Department Specific resources
For any department specific questions, the office staff should be a good point of contact. 
[Here is what we do](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/people/staff)

The [EBIO website](https://colorado.edu/ebio) is a great location for public facing data

The [EBIO SharePoint](https://o365coloradoedu.sharepoint.com/sites/ebio/) site is the go-to location for anything that wouldn't be public facing data. This includes procedures and documentation specific to our department such as:
* Finance Guidelines
	* How to request a P-Card/ Place orders on Amazon etc.
	* All documentation on Colloquium finances
* Budget requests for courses
* Printing to the EBIO Copy Machine
* Need to print posters for your class or conference?
* Booking conference rooms

[EBIO Staff - Who does what?](https://o365coloradoedu.sharepoint.com/sites/ebio/SitePages/Staff%20Responsibilites.aspx)

Resources in the EBIO Office:
* Checkout AV adapters - Bring your Buff Card
* Projectors 
* Conferencing Equipment
* IT Resources - Check with IT Staff 
    * Checkout Laptops (limited resource)
    * Cables, mice, , monitors, keyboards, etc.

## Software and hardware recommendations


### Writing
For simple projects Microsoft Word is great. For anything with complex graphics or code students might consider using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
* [Why you should LaTeX your dissertation; or, why you don't have to write your dissertation in Word](https://amrys.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/why-your-should-latex-your-dissertation-or-why-you-dont-have-to-write-your-dissertation-in-word/)
* [Why LaTeX is a better choice than MS Word](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_LaTex_is_better_choice_than_Microsoft_Word)
* Latest version of [MS Office available](https://oit.colorado.edu/software-hardware/microsoft) for CU Boulder Employees 

### Designing
PowerPoint is abysmally suited for typesetting or layers. OpenSource design software exists to compete with Adobe and PowerPoint as design solutions. Both GIMP And InkScape would compete with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator respectively. 
* [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
* [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/en/)

### Hardware
OIT Has a list of [recommendations](https://oit.colorado.edu/software-hardware/recommended-software-and-hardware-list) to consider when purchasing hardware, I tend to thing some of these are overkill.
* [Minimum supported software and hardware](https://oit.colorado.edu/software-hardware/supported-software-hardware-list)

### Teaching
[Canvas](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/teaching-learning-tools/canvas) is the preferred learning management tool for teaching at CU Boulder. Support for D2L ends after Spring 2019.

### Virtual Machines
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is an open source product from Oracle. Run Windows or Linux from your Mac or Linux from your Windows computer. 

## How to rent equipment across campus 
* [Shared Instrumentation Network](https://www.colorado.edu/sharedinstrumentation/) This is a resource for the entire CU Boulder campus that enables fundamental and applied research, and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration across our many departments, institutes and centers.
* [Buff Surplus](https://buffsurplus.colorado.edu/) Various equipment/ desks posted for campus use.
